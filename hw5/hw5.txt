1. Tree Structure for "CHEMISTRY"

					C
			H				E
		M		I		S 		T
	  R   Y


2. Explain why this is a minHeap

 	A minHeap is a complete binary tree such that the data contained in each node is less than (or equal to) the data in its node's children.

 	"CHEMISTRY" is a minHeap as it satisfies the two properties where it is a complete tree, and the character in each node comes before the characters in its children's in alphabet.

3. The resulting tree after add(D)

 					C
			D				E
		M		H		S 		T
	  R   Y	  I

4. Starting from the resulting tree from part 3, draw the tree after one call to remove()

 					D
			H				E
		M		I		S 		T
	  R   Y
