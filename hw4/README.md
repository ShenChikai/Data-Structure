## An implemented interpreter for the subset of BASIC parsed on the second project, and analyze the running time for some key operations.

# Instruction to get the Executable
## In the console, Write "make" to create the executable "hw4", and Run the executable by typing "./hw4 " followed by a .txt input file. Only correct syntax will be accepted. The executable will output whatever the input Commands are trying to do, and throw an exception and terminate the program if a error happened.

# hw4analysis.txt
## This .txt file consists of 4 parts.
### Analyze the running time for figuring out which line a GOTO, GOSUB, IF jumps to. 
### Analyze the running time for figuring out the command that a RETURN jumps to.
###	Analyze the running time for figuring out the value of a variable or overwriting the value of a variable.
### Analyze the running time for figuring out the value of an array entry, assuming numerical value of the index is known.
