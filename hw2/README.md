## This is a simple Parse for language BASIC.
## The makefile is located in the same directory with the all the other .h and .cpp files in the Interpreter folder. Simply run "make all" would compile the .o files and the executable, "basic_parse". User should type in command "./basic_parse input.txt" to parse the raw commands, assuming the syntax of the raw commands is correct.
### Please include the "input.txt" in the same folder with the makefile and all the other files.
